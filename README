# Day 13 Part 2 Solution

I looked at the AoC subreddit and learned about the Chinese Remainder Theorem
and Extended Euclidian Algorithm, but I applied it incorrectly on my first
attempt(s). I initially assumed the remainder I would be using in the solution 
would be the index of the bus in the input array, but when I examined the test
inputs I realized I was subtracting the index, meaning I needed to use the bus
ID minus the index to get a valid remainder.
